as noted, likely windows of 75 with 25 offset
FFT might be a bit dodge as sample freq unknown

using gen_train_mat and live_feat_extract from phd, adapted from established inhouse feat script.

3 slices per gesture:
0 - 75 & 25 - 100
25 - 100 & 50 - 125
50 - 125 & 75 - 150

modelling data = 350 train * 6 gestures * 3 windows + 168 victory train * 3 windows = 6804

validation data = 150 test * 6 gestures * 3 windows + 72 victory test * 3 windows = 2916


in CASH, split the traintest randomly (by gesture) and do featsel on the train split, apply to test each time.
in Final model, do the featsel on all traintest and apply to validation.

RF: trees, could also vary max_samples and max_depth a little 
SVM: linear is awkward (linear kernel in SVC tends to be slow, LinearSVC can't do probabilities), but we have LDA for a linear model
LDA: split the shrinkage by solver!


dataset csv has wrong labels, "open" should read "index"
